This page describes the invention of basketball, one of the most popular sports in the world. 

# The Inventor of Basketball

James Naismith was a college instructor at Springfield College. He wanted to make gym class more entertaining because at the end of the fall sports season, gym classes were indoors. He decided to attempt to combine parts of different sports to create a simple game that could be played indoors. He created a small set of rules and nailed two baskets to each of the gym balcony. When his students played it during gym class, basketball was born. The game grew popular very quickly and was played throughout the United States.
